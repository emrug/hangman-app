# About the project
This project is a game based on the traditional game of hangman where you try and guess a 
mystery word by selecting individual letters from the alphabet.
It is a project I created as a task for my web development bootcamp.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to play
Download the project files and in the directory run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
Then run `npm start` to play.

The aim of hangman is to guess a mystery letter by guessing individual letters. Click on letters in to guess them. 
If your guessed letter is in the mystery word then it will reveal the places where the letter appears.
If your guessed letter is not in the mystery word then you lose a life. If you lose ten lives then your stick man gets hung and you lose!
